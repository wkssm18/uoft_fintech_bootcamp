# neural_network_challenge

## Overview
In this challenge, we will construct neural network model to see the performance of it. We are asked to build a binary classifier using neural network to predict whether an applicant startup company will be successful or not. <br>
Then, we will build a several different structures of neural network in order to attempt to optimize the model.

Data provided:
- Over 34,000 records of previously funded organizations

Steps:
1. Data preparation and preprocessing
2. Model compilation and evaluation
3. Model optimization
4. Saving models
