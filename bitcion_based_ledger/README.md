# bc_based_ledger_challenge

### Overview
This challenge consists of building a simple blockchain-based ledger system using streamlit service. <br>
The python file 'pychain.py' allows the user to insert information about the sender, receiver, and the amount to be transferred, and each transaction is recorded in the blockchain-based ledger system. <br>
An extra function is added in order to validate whether the blockchain is valid or not.


### Testing the pychain ledger
